      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Rodrigo Aguayo, a PhD student in Environmental Sciences at the University of Concepci√≥n, Chile. My research interests include hydrological modeling, land-ocean interface, large-scale glacier modeling, climate change, and remote sensing. The main objective of my thesis is to assess the impacts of climate change on freshwater inputs (magnitude and source) to the coastal system of western Patagonia. Almost all my research (and my holidays!) has been in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am part of the RIO research group (Rivers Influencing the Ocean). Based on remote sensing, hydro-meteorological observations and fieldwork, we develop models to quantify the response of rivers, water resources, glaciers, and hazards to climate change. My research interests aim to contribute with adaptation plans at local and regional scales.&lt;/p&gt;
